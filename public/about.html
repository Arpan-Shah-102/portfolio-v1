                Hi, my name is <em>Arpan Shah</em> and I'm a <b>Python and Web Developer</b>.
                I started back in July 2023 with basic python but moving up to more advanced topics.
                Then school came and I didn't really program.
                I started working with Python again when I did a Raspberry Pi summer camp in July 2024.
                I learned how to program a Raspberry Pi in python with it which re-energized my want to learn programming.
                I realized that I should probably learn web development as it's a useful skill to have and I could control
                my raspberry pi using it.
            </p>

            <p>
                I started my web development journey around September 2024 by learning basic HTML & CSS.
                I convinced my parents to get me a course on full-stack development on Udemy made by Angela Yu.
                There, I learned a lot. I was quickly able to learn and do all the lessons and finsihed in less than a month.
                I'm currently working on improving my skills and learning new web development languages.
            </p>
